```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is just extra work I did not want to delete but also am not including in the main document.

Below I have tried hclustering, which did not work well. 
```{r}
dist_mat <- dist(feature_df_filtered, method = "binary")

hclust <- hclust(dist_mat, method = 'complete')
plot(hclust)
```

```{r}
cut3 <- cutree(hclust, k = 3)
```

```{r}
plot(hclust)
rect.hclust(hclust , k = 3, border = 2:6)
abline(h = 3, col = 'red')
```
